# EagleStorage

## Introduction
This is a web server application that runs on localhost and allows the user to access files stored in AWS locally. Currently the project only allows for only viewing data, the plan is for users to be able to upload, download, and move files that are stored in AWS via this locally run module. 

## Usage
This application has only been tested on Windows 10. To run the application you will want to do the following after downloading from GitHub:
  1. Create a python virtual environment somwhere on your computer and drop these files into that folder. 
  2. Open config_file.json, and input your secret access key, and access key into the associated empty strings.
  3. Activate the virtual environment and then run the depdendency installer.bat file via the command line with the activated virtual environment.
  4. Run the run.bat file by clicking on it, this will launch the application on a localhost server, to access the webpage you should CTRL+C and click on the localhost IP address
Steps 1-3 only need to be done once, step 4 must be done every time to run the application.
